# API Documentation
This isn't really an API, but more of a bunch of JSON files that constitute all the dynamic information on the website. Maybe some day there'll be a PHP file here with some parameters, but not today.

Let's take a look at what each file represents.

## points_data
`points_data.json` contains the information for the points that each house currently has, and the last time it was upated.

```
data
└───timestamp
│   file011.txt
│   file012.txt
│
├───points
│   │   bremner
│   │   howard
│   │   etc.

```
