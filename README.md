# Website for the Prefect Cup

##PSA
### The website isn't up right now, due to a DNS issue. I'm working on fixing it. In the meantime, you can visit it [here](http://159.203.27.124/prefectscup/) instead!

## About
Hey, Matthew Wang here. This repository contains everything involved in the [prefect cup website](http://pc.ucc.on.ca). It's a nice pet project that also serves some sort of useful purpose.
