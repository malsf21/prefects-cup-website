# Website for the Prefect Cup

## About
Hey, Matthew Wang here. This repository contains everything involved in the [prefect cup website](http://pc.ucc.on.ca). It's a nice pet project that also serves some sort of useful purpose. 

Right now, I'm working on `v2`. You can find my progress on v2 in the `v2` branch.

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), the framework I've used for responsive utilities, pretty web UI elements, and robust Javascript.
* [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/), the (better) framework I've used for creating that nice looking bar graph.
* [Nick Elder](http://elder.ca), the cool dude who maintained the website before me.
* [Jack Sarick](http://jack.antinode.ca), the cool dude who built a lot of the login framework that I base this one off of (for WAC).
