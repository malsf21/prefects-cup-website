# [Prefects' Cup Website](https://pc.ucc.on.ca)

**NOTE:** Over the summer, I will rewrite this tiny web-app to be a client-side only app with Firebase, so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages (and require no hosted backend). Stay tuned.

## About
Hey, Matthew Wang here. This repository contains everything involved in the [Prefects' Cup website](https://pc.ucc.on.ca). It's a nice pet project that also serves some sort of useful purpose.

## Setup

This is a work in progress -- I'll be back!
